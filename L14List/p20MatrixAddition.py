# Accept two square matrices A and B of dimensions n√ón as input and compute their sum A+B.The first line will contain the integer n. This is followed by 2n lines. Each of the first n lines is a sequence of comma-separated integers that denotes one row of the matrix A. Each of the last n lines is a sequence of comma-separated integers that denotes one row of the matrix B.
# Your output should again be a sequence of n lines, where each line is a sequence of comma-separated integer that denotes a row of the matrix A+B.
