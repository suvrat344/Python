# A n√ón square matrix of positive integers is called a magic square if the following sums are equal:
# (1) row-sum: sum of numbers in every row; there are n such values, one for each row
# (2) column-sum: sum of numbers in every column; there are n such values, one for each column
# (3) diagonal-sum: sum of numbers in both the diagonals; there are two values
# There are n+n+2=2n+2 values involved. All these values must be the same for the matrix to be a magic-square.
# Write a function named is_magic that accepts a square matrix as argument and returns YES if it is a magic-square and NO 
# if it isn't one.
