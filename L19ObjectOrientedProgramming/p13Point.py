# We are going to model points in 2D space as objects of a class named Point. Mathematical details that are relevant to solve this problem are given below:
# (1) Distance of a point P(x,y) from the origin is x2+y2.
# (2) Slope of the line joining the origin and P is y/x, for xâ‰ 0.
# Define a class named Point that has the following specification:
# Attributes
# (1) x: int, x-coordinate of the point in 2D space.
# (2) y: int, y-coordinate of the point in 2D space.
# Methods
# self is the first argument of all methods. We will only mention the additional arguments, if any.
# (1) __init__: constructor with two arguments â€” x and y; assign these two values to the corresponding attributes within the constructor
# (2) distance: return the distance of the point from the origin as a float value
# (3) is_origin: return True if the point coincides with the origin, and False otherwise
# (4) on_xaxis: return True if the point is on the x-axis, and False otherwise
# (5) on_yaxis: return True if the point is on the y-axis and False otherwise
# (6) quadrant: return the quadrant that this point belongs to; assume that this method will only be called if the point is not on either of the axes; possible return values are ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth'].
# (7) slope: return the slope of the line joining the origin and this point as a float value; assume that this method will only be called if the point is not on the y-axis
# Input                                      Expected Output
# Test Case1
# Point(1, 3)                                      3.16
# print(f'{P.distance():.2f}')
# Test Case2
# Point(0, 10)                                     True
# print(P.on_yaxis())
# Test Case3
# Point(-5, -10)                                   third
# print(P.quadrant())
