# Create a class named StringManipulation that has the following specification:
# Attributes
# words: list of strings, all of which will be in lower case
# Methods
# (1) __init__: accept a list words as argument and assign it to the corresponding attribute
# (2) total_words: return the total number of words in words
# (3) count: accept an argument named some_word and return the number of times this word occurs in the list words
# (4) words_of_length: accept a positive integer length as argument and return a list of all the words in the list words that have a length equal to length
# (5) words_start_with: accept a character char as argument and return the list of all the words in words that start with char
# (6) longest_word: return the longest word in the list words; if there are multiple words that satisfy this condition,return the first such occurrence
# (7) palindromes: return a list of all the words that are palindromes in words
# (1) For those methods where you are expected to return a list of words, make sure that the words in the returned list appear in the order in which they are present in the attribute words.
# (2) Each test case corresponds to one or more method calls. We will use S to denote the name of the object.
# Input                                                                              Expected Output
# Test Case1
# StringManipulation(['a', 'an', 'the', 'mom', 'that'])                                ['the', 'mom']

# Test Case2
# StringManipulation(['a', 'mom', 'the', 'an'])                                        ['a', 'mom']
# S.palindromes()
